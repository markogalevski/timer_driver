This driver took a bit more creative thinking to be able to combine both regular timer usage and more complex compare/capture usage into a single interface. Of course it became two interfaces, the timer\+\_\+interface and timer\+\_\+cc\+\_\+interface. An extra challenge was thinking through how to get the exact same driver to work for the three different types of timers on the stm32\+F411\+XE. The answer was to work around the weakest ones (T\+I\+M10 and T\+I\+M11). All fancy advanced features of T\+I\+M1 must be accessed the hard way with register reads and writes.
